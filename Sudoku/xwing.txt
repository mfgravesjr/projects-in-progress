Simple Colouring... iterate through the following process for each number 1-9: go through every cell and store as odd colour, and from there, search every unit for another cell which forms a conjugate pair with current index and mark that as an even colour. repeat for each conjugate pair until no more are found. If conjugate pair is already located previously, would it be marked for the same colour? If so, ignore it. If not

Y-Wing... if cell has 2 candidates inside, then for int[]{cand1,cand2} step through all cells of each shared block. if comparing cell also has 2 candidates, and one is the number being compared in the for-each-loop, remember the second number and follow a nested loop for all cells within all shared blocks and mark all occurrences of that number as possible removable candidates. Second loop through (for cand2), through all cells of each shared block, if comparing cell also has 2 candidates and one is the number being compared in the for-each-loop, remember the second, and follow a nested loop for all cells within all shared blocks and mark all occurrences of that number as possible removable candidates. Compare to lists of possible removable candidates, and if they share an index and value, then remove it.
