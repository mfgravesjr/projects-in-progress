... cycle IS complete
trim references
(J7, H9, H3, G2, C2, C7)

(maybe not mod... because if we're trimming the cycle, we could be trimming off an odd number, which would make evens what we would expect to be odds)

if references.size() % 2 == 0, (even number) then compare every sequence of two references and eliminate the test number from all visible cells between the two (not including themselves).

if references.size() % 2 == 1, (odd number) then eliminate every candidate except for the test number from the current reference cell
